Regrettably, I don't recall where I got these scripts from originally, but they are **NOT** my own personal work -- with one exception -- the 'armv7' variant is a modified version of the original author's 'armv7s' script.  If you are the original author, please let me know if (a) you'd like to be attributed and/or linked, or (b) if you need me to take these down and I'll gladly do either, though in the latter case, please link me back to where you've posted these just so I can verify you are who you say you are.
